            <p>Initial stage is an MSI file, which at a high level shows it is related to AutoIT.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Further review of available string data shows this AutoIT script was converted/wrapped into an MSI with a tool from exemsi.com.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image44.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since this is just an MSI file, we can treat it like any other compressed file and explore with 7z.  Note: As it was hard to tell exactly what files were unique and which were included as part of the wrapper, I did create a file with that tool to weed out expected items.  At this point, the main item of interest is the cab file.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This CAB file can also be treated like any compressed file and it contains the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The thought here is that the MSI is going to launch the AutoIT interpreter seen here and pass the actual script in the command line.  eTtZ and AutoIt3.exe are both to support launching of the payload and are not as interesting as finding the script at this point.  The assumption is that the script is in bybq as the pdf seems benign.  Searching for the known starting hex (header) values in a AutoIT script of: A3 48 4B BE 98 6C 4A A9 99 4C 53 0A, you can see that here:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image43.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a good write-up and more details about what we want/need to do here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2015/01/08/decompiling-compiled-autoit-scripts-64-bit-take-two/">https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2015/01/08/decompiling-compiled-autoit-scripts-64-bit-take-two/</a></p>
<p>Basically, to perform more static analysis I want to get the raw script out.  Manually snagging this script out and trying to convert with something like “Exe2Aut.exe”, results in an error about it being unable to be decompiled.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Following instructions on the previously linked site, we basically need to use an older AutoIT 32 bit stub (AutoItSC.bin) to convert this first.  Since this is a stub, we are just opening both and appending one to the other, which is pretty straight forward.  The script on that page does work but perl isn’t something I normally keep installed, so I converted it to Python.  The script also looks for that known header value and carves it out of the larger data file.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we can let Exe2Aut.exe decompile for us.</p>
<p>We can now see the decompiled script.  Which looks to be building a very long string a chunk at a time by appending each one to the string variable “zywambmzzn”.  It should also be noted, between each one of these, it declares another function that isn’t actually used and looks to just be for padding.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image41.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After joining the very long string and removing the “Local $*” items, it cleans up to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are two hex values that decode:</p>
<p>Further cleanup shows the script will exit if the program files directory doesn’t exist and the user is not ‘system’. Next there is a check for “sophos”, specifically as to if it should execute VirtualProtect  If that doesn’t exist, it calls VirtualProtect and gives the memory protection constant of 0x40 (Execute Read/Write) for the memory location of the payload (this step is needed for the next step).  Lastly, it will call “CallWindowProc” and pass that payload as the first arg, which will execute as if it were a function.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image25.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As there is no discernible executable header here, we will assume it is shellcode.  I wrote it out to a file and then pulled it into Ghidra.  Going to the first instruction and hitting ‘d’, it will treat it like code and decompile.</p>
<p>The shellcode file hash is:</p>
<p>56BE768AA09FFFC4E3F4A992C0149F28FF50746E92FA570629F457BDF0436F52</p>
<p>It is available on VT but flagged as clean.</p>
<p>Now we can actually see what it is doing and that it is shellcode.  It is using the MOV instruction and creating an executable in memory one byte at a time.  We can see the 4d 5a at the start.  There are multiple ways to dump this, however the quickest is to run the shellcode in a debugger, set a breakpoint after it is done and dump at that point.  This way we can also review some of the additional actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image32.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To run shellcode in a debugger, the easiest way is to use runsc32.exe as this loads the shellcode but pauses the execution long enough for you to attach a debugger and set a breakpoint at the correct memory location.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image22.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This now brings us to the start of the shellcode:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Manually scrolling to the end and setting a breakpoint:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We now have a region of memory containing the executable (which we will dump):</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image34.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this loop, the program is looking for functions based on two partial hex values.  The first 50746547, decoded and converted from little endian, gives us the string “GetP”, the second value of 65726464 decodes to “ddre”.  The goal here is to find “GetProcaddress”</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image39.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It now moves in a stacked string for LoadLibraryA VirtualAlloc.  The order of operations would now be, LoadLibraryA will return a handle to VirtualAlloc and then this will be passed to GetProcaddress.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image28.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Which we can see returned in EAX here:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image23.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This function is called here with the following args.  System determined address, size of 0xF4240, mem commit and execute read/write.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I think we can see where this is going and that this is pretty standard as it eventually jumps to a region of memory that contains the executable (the call to the mem region in both screenshots below):</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image38.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is our new file:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the overlay removed, the hash is listed on VT as a generic Trojan:</p>
<p>D15CCAFD4FF7967C4E692C65B042BD777DD3AE556D6CA29F86AC1571FEE977B0</p>
<p>Doing a quick check with Capa, there are some interesting items to review:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image42.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using static and dynamic analysis I noticed it was looking for a file given to it by way of a command line arg.  Absent that, it will look for an AutoIt (au3) script as previously noted.  Trying the same bybq file that the initial script was embedded in, I was able to continue analysis.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image40.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image37.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this program, the entry point is actually main.  The first item that is interesting is directly after the command args are checked, ReadFile is called (eventually from FUN_004030EC) on the file given in the arg.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image36.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, it moves the value 0x7C at 0x04036a9 from a predefined location in the program:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image24.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It can be seen here:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image33.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Scan string here with repeat while not equal (repne scasb), comparing the value in AL (accumulator) to the string in EDI and stops when it is found:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Which was moved from esi in a previous instruction:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see that the string value stored stopped here with the ascii string “Mamuzxsbzu|&hellip;”</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The offset is calculated here for this match.  EAX-EDX = 0x1F4E</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This operation is repeated looking for 0x7c again “|”, to mark the start of the needed data.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yet again it is repeated to identify the end of the payload and is the main separator being used here to identify start/end of important data.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image27.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The string “Mamuzxsbzu” has the “M” replaced with a hard coded character (‘a’) stored here and also drops the ‘u’:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That is moved from this location here right at 0x004036EC, before the function that appends it:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image31.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point we have the payload extracted from the file.  There is a quick function that performs a b64 decode (also identified by CAPA):</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image46.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After returning from that function, it enters an XOR function (also identified by CAPA):</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This loop takes the string “aamuzxsbz” along with its length and generates the correct XOR value to decode the payload.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In that loop, it takes the length, XORs it with the first character, then one character at a time, continues to XOR with the previous result.</p>
<p>To help visualize this and confirm actions, I wrote a quick Python script:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image26.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The result here is 0x78.</p>
<p>The last part of generating the payload is a modified XOR operation.  The b64 decoded chunk of data is XOR’d one byte at a time with 0x78, which was generated in the last step.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The unique item here is that there is bitwise NOT performed after the XOR operation (‘not dl’).</p>
<p>We can now see a decrypted exe:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because of how things like Powershell and Python handle bitwise NOT with signed/unsigned values, it doesn’t quite work the same.  To achieve the same result, I updated a previous Powershell script that performs simple XOR on a file and updated it to show how you would achieve this.  Notice the highlighted shift left operation (creating a mask) to mimic the same functionality.  There are multiple easy to achieve this same action but In Python I would do an ‘&amp; 0xFF’ to create the mask.</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image30.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After decrypting the payload, we can see with just strings alone, the functionality and what it likely is:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Initial check with Capa:</p>
<p><img src="https://xd43d41u5x.github.io/malwaREAnalysis/images/posts/darkgate/image29.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A known tactic for this malware is using a modified base64 table for string encryption.  Taking everything we have seen so far along with this, I wrote a script to do the following:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a suspected file (bybq here) as input</li>
<li>Find the key - based on separators we save above.</li>
<li>Find the Payload - again separators.</li>
<li>Calculate the new xor key - xoring length with each part of itself.</li>
<li>Perform modified xor decrypt - including the bitwise NOT.</li>
<li>Write out final payload.</li>
<li>Search payload for base64 modified tables - As this is modified b64, these will be exactly 64 characters in length.</li>
<li>Can use any found tables or known default values seen in this sample.</li>
<li>Using new tables, decode the b64.</li>
<li>Attempt to find config - looking for patterns like ‘1=*’, ‘2=*”, then if found, find the C2 url/ip.</li>
<li>Note: I am not being picky or trying to figure out which strings go with which table.  I attempt all strings with all tables and write those out into two files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes already produced strings output as a file.</li>
<li>Does the same other items as before (find tables, decode, write-out, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>This script will be linked at the end.</p>
<p>Another way to achieve this would be to identify strings of interest by creating a Ghidra script and pointing it at the decrypt function.  It does stand out and is called hundreds of times, however, I wanted to make sure all strings were accounted for just in case there were chained functions hiding the wanted string.</p>
<p>So what was the main goal here?  While a lot of the strings can be seen, the config cannot and it contains the C2 IP.</p>
<p>The config here is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hxxp://107\[.\]181\[.\]161\[.\]200
0=443
1=Yes
2=Yes
3=No
5=No
4=100
6=No
8=No
7=4096
9=No
10=cBdCbB
11=No
12=No
13=Yes
14=4
15=yrTGfypyQTkETa
16=4
17=No
18=No
19=No
</code></pre><p>I won’t link the entire output but some interesting strings found are:</p>
