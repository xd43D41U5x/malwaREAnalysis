      <description>The JS starts with a fake Angular comment followed by multiple references to Angular in variable names.
The first item to note is the dead code that was injected during this obfuscation. To start cleaning this up, look at the patterns of variable declarations and junk functions that are never actually referenced such as:
Once you start cutting those items out it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see this is a variation of obfuscator io.</description>

      <description>This starts like a normal ISO file style malware, LNK file (ending in .pdf) and hidden dll (here named thumbs.db).
Compliance-checklist.pdf = 9C54FCA1F05AC5442EEBBDC7C02ADA2389DAD61160D8DAEECD568B318964B19A
Thumbs.db = SHA256 = 252A8525216A2D068B7C92C14CD7292FB776193EDDB18E2AE5C11DBF9E1CFE46
The LNK file has a visible link of:
However, there is much more:
Somewhat clean version:
Basically, it is looking for MS Teams in the users local app data directory, then renaming ffmpeg.dll to orgcr32.dll. Ffmpeg is a legit dependency for Teams, however the orgcr32 is not.</description>

      <description>Summary Physical Files Involved 3CXDesktopApp.exe - Has a dependency for ffmpeg.dll. This initial exe appears to be clean. ffmpeg.dll - This dll has been modified at the entry point, so that even upon loading of the dll (no export calls), the malicious code would run. Note: this is an expected file for an electron app. d3dcompiler_47.dll - This dll functions as normal, however has RC4 encrypted data added in the overlay.</description>

      <description>Analysis For this sample, the batch file decrypts two payloads, one is another unpacker/dropper and the other is a .Net executable with a singular purpose of bypassing ETW so that EDR and AV will not stop the final payload. The .Net unpacker/dropper contains resources that it decodes then loads into memory. One of which looks to be XWorm (based on C2 strings) and the other is an unidentified native/compiled executable that will be covered in a separate report.</description>

      <description>Analysis To start, we will only be looking at the two files of interest and not the whole thing (background.js and promo.jpg). By looking in background.js, there is an area that stands out, with a variable named “Promo” and a function defined/called there.
A couple of notes before digging into how this works.
It&amp;rsquo;s referencing a jpg file (really a png) and it&amp;rsquo;s drawing/loading that image.
So at some point we will realize this is a requirement and since VSCode uses Node.</description>

      <description>Analysis I’ll start by saying this probably isn’t the right name, but based on write-ups I’ve seen similar but not exactly the same items. It feels like a mash up between SideCopy/SideWinder and NightFury.
As a quick summary here is what the overall flow looks like.
This attack starts with a zip file being delivered to the user. The zip file contains what would appear to an end user as a “docx”, however it&amp;rsquo;s really a link file which is abusing the target parameter to pull external content, in this case the 2nd stage to be launched with mshta.</description>
