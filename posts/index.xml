      <description>Summary Physical Files Involved: 3CXDesktopApp.exe - Has a dependency for ffmpeg.dll. This initial exe appears to be clean. ffmpeg.dll - This dll has been modified at the entry point, so that even upon loading of the dll (no export calls), the malicious code would run. Note: this is an expected file for an electron app. d3dcompiler_47.dll - This dll functions as normal, however has RC4 encrypted data added in the overlay.</description>
